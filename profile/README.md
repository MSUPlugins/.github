## Welcome
You reached the homepage of The Minecraft Server Utilities project. The MSU project aims to provide a range of lightweight and easy-to-use Minecraft server utility plugins.

MSU plugins are designed to be [PlugMan](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/plugman)-friendly, which means you can use PlugMan to load, unload and reload MSU plugins at server runtime.
Based on the design philosophy, each plugin will only have one topic and won't have much extra functionality unless it has to.

All plugins have been designed with internationalization in mind and have been tested on production servers. If you encountered any problem or want to contribute to the project, feel free to create an issue or pull request.
